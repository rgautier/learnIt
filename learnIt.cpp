//A section will go here to include all of the header files for my
//personal classes that I create
//Starting examples of classes we'll need will be:
//The Brain Class - a class that will be linked to the bot's brain of memories
//memory class - used by the brain class, but refers to specific memories (and properties thereof)
//web interface class - used to connect to the web
//search engine class - used to create search queries within the brain itself
//source class - used to store information about sources, including reputation data
//Note: source may have relationships between sources so that reputation is linked to 'group' reputations as well.
//Utility class - a class that contains any reusable code that will go into another class in the future
